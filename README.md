# 🌟 Marketing Analytics & Customer Segmentation — End-to-End Data Analytics Project




📊 Python | EDA | Data Cleaning | RFM | CLV | K-Means | DBSCAN | Visualization | Business Insights




🚀 A real-world, production-style data analytics project built using Python.


This project demonstrates my complete data analyst skillset — from handling messy, large-scale datasets to generating insights that optimize marketing decisions.




📌 1. Project Overview


Modern marketing teams collect huge volumes of customer data but lack clarity on who their customers are, which channels work, and where marketing spend is wasted.


This project solves that problem by analyzing a large, messy, real-world–like dataset (125k+ rows) to uncover actionable insights, build customer segments, and derive data-backed marketing recommendations.




🎯 2. Project Objectives


✔ Build a real-time, production-like analytics pipeline using Python


✔ Clean and process a large, unclean, noisy dataset


✔ Perform full Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)


✔ Engineer features like RFM & CLV


✔ Segment customers using K-Means & DBSCAN


✔ Generate insights that improve marketing targeting, retention, and ROI


✔ Present results clearly with visualizations & business recommendations




🧠 3. Tech Stack & Skills Demonstrated

📂 4. About the Dataset



A synthetic but realistic marketing dataset created using Python to mimic real-world customer behavior.



📌 Dataset Highlights


- 125,000+ rows


- Contains:


- Demographics (age, gender, location)


- Financial data (income, spend, purchase frequency)


- Marketing engagement (email, CTR, ads)


- Date fields


- Noise, dirty data, inconsistencies


- Includes:


- Missing values


- Outliers


- Random noise


- Duplicates


- Inconsistent categorization


- Perfect for demonstrating real-world data cleaning & analytics skills.




🧹 5. Data Cleaning & Preparation


What I performed:


✔ Removed duplicates


✔ Handled missing values using:


- Median


- “Unknown” / “Not Available”


✔ Standardized categorical text


✔ Converted datatypes


✔ Rounded numeric values


✔ Fixed inconsistent formatting


✔ Capped outliers for stable statistical analysis


✔ Removed irrelevant noise columns


✔ Engineered new features (date-based, RFM, CLV)


- This step alone demonstrates strong foundational skills every data analyst must have.




📊 6. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)


- Highlights from EDA:




📌 Customer Demographics


- Even gender distribution (~50/50), 17% unknown


- Largest age group: 25–45 years


- Major customer hubs: Mumbai > Delhi > Bangalore




📌 Marketing Channel Insights


- Top channels: Social Media, SMS, Email


- Ads show lowest engagement & revenue contribution


- 15k+ entries have unknown channels → tracking issues




📌 Engagement Insights


- Email open rate peaks at ~25%


- CTR mostly between 4%–10%


- Ad interactions mostly between 1–3




📌 Purchase & Revenue Patterns


- Purchase count typically 5–10


- Spending peaks around ₹8k–₹10k


- Higher frequency → higher monetary value


- Mumbai contributes the highest revenue




📌 Correlation


- No strong linear relationships → behavior influenced by multiple independent factors




🧮 7. Feature Engineering



🚀 RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)

- Used to understand purchasing behavior.



🧮 CLV (Customer Lifetime Value)

- CLV = Avg Purchase Value × Frequency × Customer Lifespan


✔ Added features into the main dataset for segmentation.




🧩 8. Customer Segmentation


🔷 K-Means Clustering


- Elbow & PCA indicate 4 optimal clusters:


- Cluster	Profile


- 0	Active, frequent buyers


- 1	Least recent buyers (low engagement)


- 2	Highest spenders (valuable segment)


- 3	Medium spenders with high ad interactions




🔶 DBSCAN


- All points form 1 major cluster


- A few outliers detected


- DBSCAN not ideal for this dataset → K-Means works better




📌 9. Key Insights


🎯 Customer Behavior


- Spending patterns are diverse with no strong age or income influence


- Engagement varies widely — many customers ignore marketing emails


- Most customers fall in Potential or At-Risk RFM segments




💰 Revenue Insights


- Mumbai is the strongest revenue driver


- Social Media, Email, SMS outperform Ads


- High-frequency buyers consistently bring higher monetary value




🧠 Segmentation Insights


- Cluster 2 offers the highest revenue opportunity


- Cluster 1 requires win-back campaigns


- Cluster 3 responds well to ads


- Cluster 0 is stable and active




📝 10. Conclusion
